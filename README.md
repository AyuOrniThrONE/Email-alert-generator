# Email-alert-generator
In this era of hectic schedules and constant work pressure, it is very difficult for anyone to keep up with and track regarding everything. The human mind may not be able to retain information for a very long time and may be replaced with more important work and information, which can result in some losses that may befinancial or educational. Missing crucial emails, such as job notifications, company emails, and college mail, which may contain deadlines, critical messages, and essential information, is one of the concern.
## Objective:
1. Real-Time Alerts: Get alerted in real-time when important emails arrive, allowing you to respond promptly and stay on top of time-sensitive matters.
2. Efficient Communication: Seamless Integration: Connect your email accounts to create a unified communication experience, reducing the need to switch between multiple platforms.
3. Timely Response: Priority Handling: Focus on emails that trigger alerts, ensuring quick responses to urgent matters and preventing critical emails from getting buried.
4. Personalized Updates: Targeted Alerts: Tailor your notifications based on sender importance or email content, ensuring that only relevant emails trigger app notifications.
## Problem Statement
The Project is to create an automated system that notifies the incoming email specifically emails that may be necessary, critical, and have some urgency, through an Application in the form of automatic alerts, which would give users a reminder of those specific emails.
## Proposed System

## Module Description
1. Flutter App Development: Developed the basic application on the basis of User Interface(UI) designed with  respect to basic operations which is needed or wish to do.
   Following are the images regarding the basic UI (not yet finalized).
   1. First we opened android development software Android Studio and set it up.
   2. We created the default flutter app module and named it as Major.
   3. Cleared all the code regarding the default app and set parameters according to the UI based on what we created. We defined appBar class and defined thier subclasses for the columns which we have defined. For now we have defined Inbox, Sent/Action, and Saved column. Further we have developed the code for Inbox Screen.
   4. We defined body attributes in StateFull widget with Name EmailScreen.dart, in which the tile for every upcoming inbox user is made creating variables like ProfileImage, username, subject, body, and DateTime which provide how many hours ago the following email have arrived.
